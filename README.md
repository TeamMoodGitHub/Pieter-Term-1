# Pieter-Term-1

I'm interested in real time CS analysis through inspecting current game state. To start we need to do a little research on what language we want to write the analysis/web server app in. 

Week 1
I made simple hello world servers in both Python and Go by following some beginner's tutorials. At this point it is hard to say which language is better for me, but I do wanna continue with Python because I know my uni has started teaching Python to new students, so I feel like it makes more sense for me.
